Ok I decided to scrap the neural network idea. Sounds way too complicated for a class project.
What I can do that is not that far from my original idea and is still pretty cool, is 
create a bot that you can either send a meme image to, or make it find the image for you.
It then sends the image (or a bunch of them for the user to make a selection from) to the
user in a private chat. The user then chooses the image and gives the bot some text to add
to it. Then it adds the user's requested meme text with the classic meme font. 
Users should be able to control the size and the placement of the text if they want. 
The bot should also be able to add a blank white space at the top of the image if needed.
